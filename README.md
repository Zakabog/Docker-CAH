#Cards Against Humanity, online edition

I was bored and wanted to work on a Docker project so I built a version of Cards Against Humanity that runs in Docker, you'll need to create the card files "white.txt" and "black.txt" with each "card" separated by a newline. There are PDFs available online from CAH if you want the official cards, but you'll have to find and parse them yourself.

Example:
'''
  white.txt -
    Obama
    A cat throwing up
    Coffee

  black.txt -
    They call me "Mr. \_\_\_\_!"
    Where do babies come from?
